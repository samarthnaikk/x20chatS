# P2P Texting Application

A peer-to-peer (P2P) texting application built with Python that enables direct, decentralized communication between users without the need for a central server. This project aims to provide secure, private, and reliable text messaging through a distributed network architecture.

## High-Level Goals

- Create a decentralized messaging system where users can communicate directly
- Ensure privacy and security in peer-to-peer communications
- Build a scalable and maintainable codebase
- Provide an intuitive user experience
- Support cross-platform functionality

## Features

_To be determined - features will be documented as they are implemented_

## Architecture

_To be determined - architectural decisions and system design will be documented as the project evolves_

## Setup

_To be determined - setup instructions will be provided once the application is implemented_
